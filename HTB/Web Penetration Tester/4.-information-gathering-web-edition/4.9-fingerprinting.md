# 4.9 Fingerprinting

Fingerprinting focuses on extracting technical details about the technologies powering a website or web application.

### Fingerprinting Techniques

There are several techniques used for web server and technology fingerprinting:

* **Banner grabbing** means looking at the information a server sends when you connect to it. This banner often shows the server type and version, which can give clues about possible weaknesses.
* **Analysing HTTP headers** involves checking the extra information sent with web requests and responses. Headers like `Server` or `X-Powered-By` can reveal the web server, programming language, or framework being used.
* **Probing for specific responses** means sending special or unusual requests to see how the server reacts. Different servers respond differently to errors or unexpected input, which can help identify the technology behind them.
* **Analysing page content** focuses on what is visible in the web page itself. The page structure, comments, scripts, or copyright messages can hint at the frameworks, CMS, or tools used to build the site.

A variety of tools exist that automate the fingerprinting process, combining various techniques to identify web servers, operating systems, content management systems, and other technologies:

| Tool         | Description                                                                                                           | Features                                                                                            |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Wappalyzer` | Browser extension and online service for website technology profiling.                                                | Identifies a wide range of web technologies, including CMSs, frameworks, analytics tools, and more. |
| `BuiltWith`  | Web technology profiler that provides detailed reports on a website's technology stack.                               | Offers both free and paid plans with varying levels of detail.                                      |
| `WhatWeb`    | Command-line tool for website fingerprinting.                                                                         | Uses a vast database of signatures to identify various web technologies.                            |
| `Nmap`       | Versatile network scanner that can be used for various reconnaissance tasks, including service and OS fingerprinting. | Can be used with scripts (NSE) to perform more specialised fingerprinting.                          |
| `Netcraft`   | Offers a range of web security services, including website fingerprinting and security reporting.                     | Provides detailed reports on a website's technology, hosting provider, and security posture.        |
| `wafw00f`    | Command-line tool specifically designed for identifying Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).                             | Helps determine if a WAF is present and, if so, its type and configuration.                         |

### Banner Grabbing

Our first step is to gather information directly from the web server itself. We can do this using the `curl` command with the `-I` flag (or `--head`) to fetch only the HTTP headers, not the entire page content.

```bash
curl -I inlanefreight.com

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Fri, 31 May 2024 12:07:44 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Location: https://inlanefreight.com/
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
```

Here, we see that `inlanefreight.com` is running on `Apache/2.4.41`, specifically the `Ubuntu` version. This information is our first clue, hinting at the underlying technology stack. It's also trying to redirect to `https://inlanefreight.com/` so grab those banners too

```bash
curl -I https://inlanefreight.com

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Fri, 31 May 2024 12:12:12 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
X-Redirect-By: WordPress
Location: https://www.inlanefreight.com/
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

We now get a really interesting header, the server is trying to redirect us again, but this time we see that it's `WordPress` that is doing the redirection to `https://www.inlanefreight.com/`

```bash
curl -I https://www.inlanefreight.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 31 May 2024 12:12:26 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/index.php/wp-json/>; rel="https://api.w.org/"
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/pages/7>; rel="alternate"; type="application/json"
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/>; rel=shortlink
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

A few more interesting headers, including an interesting path that contains `wp-json`. The `wp-` prefix is common to WordPress.

### Wafw00f

`Web Application Firewalls` (`WAFs`) are security solutions designed to protect web applications from various attacks. Before proceeding with further fingerprinting, it's crucial to determine if `inlanefreight.com` employs a WAF, as it could interfere with our probes or potentially block our requests.

To detect the presence of a WAF, we'll use the `wafw00f` tool. To install `wafw00f`, you can use pip3:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv    # Create virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate    # Activate the virtual environment
pip3 install git+https://github.com/EnableSecurity/wafw00f    # Downlaod/Install dependency or tools
deactivate    # Deactivate the virtual environment
```

Once it's installed, pass the domain you want to check as an argument to the tool:

```bash
wafw00f inlanefreight.com

                ______
               /      \
              (  W00f! )
               \  ____/
               ,,    __            404 Hack Not Found

### Nikto

`Nikto` is a powerful open-source web server scanner. In addition to its primary function as a vulnerability assessment tool, `Nikto's` fingerprinting capabilities provide insights into a website's technology stack.

If you need to install it, you can run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y perl
git clone https://github.com/sullo/nikto
cd nikto/program
chmod +x ./nikto.pl
```

To scan `inlanefreight.com` using `Nikto`, only running the fingerprinting modules, execute the following command:

```bash
nikto -h inlanefreight.com -Tuning b
```

The `-h` flag specifies the target host. The `-Tuning b` flag tells `Nikto` to only run the Software Identification modules.

`Nikto` will then initiate a series of tests, attempting to identify outdated software, insecure files or configurations, and other potential security risks.

```bash
nikto -h inlanefreight.com -Tuning b
