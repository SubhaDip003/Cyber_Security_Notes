# 4.3 DNS

DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1), which computers use to identify each other on the network.

### How DNS Works

Imagine you want to visit a website like `www.example.com`. You type this friendly domain name into your browser, but your computer doesn't understand words – it speaks the language of numbers, specifically IP addresses. So, how does your computer find the website's IP address? Enter DNS, the internet's trusty translator.

1. **Your Computer Asks for Directions (DNS Query):** When you enter the domain name, your computer first checks its memory (cache) to see if it remembers the IP address from a previous visit. If not, it reaches out to a DNS resolver, usually provided by your internet service provider (ISP).
2. **The DNS Resolver Checks its Map (Recursive Lookup):** The resolver also has a cache, and if it doesn't find the IP address there, it starts a journey through the DNS hierarchy. It begins by asking a root name server, which is like the librarian of the internet.
3. **Root Name Server Points the Way:** The root server doesn't know the exact address but knows who does – the Top-Level Domain (TLD) name server responsible for the domain's ending (e.g., .com, .org). It points the resolver in the right direction.
4. **TLD Name Server Narrows It Down:** The TLD name server is like a regional map. It knows which authoritative name server is responsible for the specific domain you're looking for (e.g., `example.com`) and sends the resolver there.
5. **Authoritative Name Server Delivers the Address:** The authoritative name server is the final stop. It's like the street address of the website you want. It holds the correct IP address and sends it back to the resolver.
6. **The DNS Resolver Returns the Information:** The resolver receives the IP address and gives it to your computer. It also remembers it for a while (caches it), in case you want to revisit the website soon.
7. **Your Computer Connects:** Now that your computer knows the IP address, it can connect directly to the web server hosting the website, and you can start browsing.

#### The Hosts File

The `hosts` file is a simple text file used to map hostnames to IP addresses, providing a manual method of domain name resolution that bypasses the DNS process. While DNS automates the translation of domain names to IP addresses, the `hosts` file allows for direct, local overrides. This can be particularly useful for development, troubleshooting, or blocking websites.

The `hosts` file is located in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows and in `/etc/hosts` on Linux and MacOS. Each line in the file follows the format:

```
<IP Address>    <Hostname> [<Alias> ...]
```

For example:

```txt
127.0.0.1       localhost
192.168.1.10    devserver.local
```

Blocking unwanted websites by redirecting their domains to a non-existent IP address:

```
0.0.0.0       unwanted-site.com
```

#### Key DNS Concepts

In the `Domain Name System` (`DNS`), a `zone` is a distinct part of the domain namespace that a specific entity or administrator manages. Think of it as a virtual container for a set of domain names. For example, `example.com` and all its subdomains (like `mail.example.com` or `blog.example.com`) would typically belong to the same DNS zone.

The zone file, a text file residing on a DNS server, defines the resource records (discussed below) within this zone, providing crucial information for translating domain names into IP addresses.

To illustrate, here's a simplified example of what a zone file, for `example.com` might look like:

```
$TTL 3600 ; Default Time-To-Live (1 hour)
@       IN SOA   ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. (
                2024060401 ; Serial number (YYYYMMDDNN)
                3600       ; Refresh interval
                900        ; Retry interval
                604800     ; Expire time
                86400 )    ; Minimum TTL

@       IN NS    ns1.example.com.
@       IN NS    ns2.example.com.
@       IN MX 10 mail.example.com.
www     IN A     192.0.2.1
mail    IN A     198.51.100.1
ftp     IN CNAME www.example.com.
```

This file defines the authoritative name servers (`NS` records), mail server (`MX` record), and IP addresses (`A` records) for various hosts within the `example.com` domain.

DNS servers store various resource records, each serving a specific purpose in the domain name resolution process. Let's explore some of the most common DNS concepts:

| DNS Concept                   | Description                                                                      | Example                                                                                                                                 |

| **IP Address**                | A unique numerical identifier assigned to each device connected to the internet. | `192.0.2.1`                                                                                                                             |
| **DNS Resolver**              | A server that translates domain names into IP addresses.                         | Your ISP's DNS server or public resolvers like Google DNS (`8.8.8.8`)                                                                   |
| **Root Name Server**          | The top-level servers in the DNS hierarchy.                                      | There are 13 root servers worldwide, named A-M: `a.root-servers.net`                                                                    |
| **TLD Name Server**           | Servers responsible for specific top-level domains (e.g., .com, .org).           | [Verisign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisign) for `.com`, [PIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Interest_Registry) for `.org` |
| **Authoritative Name Server** | The server that holds the actual IP address for a domain.                        | Often managed by hosting providers or domain registrars.                                                                                |
| **DNS Record Types**          | Different types of information stored in DNS.                                    | A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT, etc.                                                                                                       |

#### Types of DNS Records

These records store different types of data associated with domain names, each serving a specific purpose:

| Record Type | Full Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                 | Zone File Example                                                                              |

| **NS**      | Name Server Record        | Delegates a DNS zone to a specific authoritative name server.                                                                               | `example.com.` IN NS `ns1.example.com.`                                                        |
| **TXT**     | Text Record               | Stores arbitrary text information, often used for domain verification or security policies.                                                 | `example.com.` IN TXT `"v=spf1 mx -all"` (SPF record)                                          |
| **SOA**     | Start of Authority Record | Specifies administrative information about a DNS zone, including the primary name server, responsible person's email, and other parameters. | `example.com.` IN SOA `ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. 2024060301 10800 3600 604800 86400` |
| **SRV**     | Service Record            | Defines the hostname and port number for specific services.                                                                                 | `_sip._udp.example.com.` IN SRV 10 5 5060 `sipserver.example.com.`                             |
| **PTR**     | Pointer Record            | Used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping an IP address to a hostname.                                                                          | `1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.` IN PTR `www.example.com.`                                            |

The "`IN`" in the examples stands for "Internet." It's a class field in DNS records that specifies the protocol family. In most cases, you'll see "`IN`" used, as it denotes the Internet protocol suite (IP) used for most domain names. Other class values exist (e.g., `CH` for Chaosnet, `HS` for Hesiod) but are rarely used in modern DNS configurations.

In essence, "`IN`" is simply a convention that indicates that the record applies to the standard internet protocols we use today. While it might seem like an extra detail, understanding its meaning provides a deeper understanding of DNS record structure.

#### Why DNS Matters for Web Recon

**Uncovering Assets**\
DNS records help you discover what systems an organization is using. By checking records like A, CNAME, MX, and NS, you can find subdomains, mail servers, and external services. Sometimes these records point to old or forgotten servers, which may still be online and vulnerable.

**Mapping the Network Infrastructure**\
DNS gives a high-level view of how a target’s infrastructure is set up. Name server records can show the hosting provider, while specific records may reveal load balancers, application servers, or internal services. This helps you understand how different parts of the system connect and where weaknesses might exist.

**Monitoring for Changes**\
Watching DNS over time can expose new attack surfaces. New subdomains may indicate newly deployed services, and TXT records can leak information about tools or services the organization uses. These changes can highlight fresh entry points or useful details for further attacks.
