# 4.1 Introduction

Web reconnaissance is the first step in any security assessment or penetration testing engagement. It's akin to a detective's initial investigation, meticulously gathering clues and evidence about a target before formulating a plan of action. In the digital realm, this translates to accumulating information about a website or web application to identify potential vulnerabilities, security misconfigurations, and valuable assets.

The primary goals of web reconnaissance revolve around gaining a comprehensive understanding of the target's digital footprint. This includes:

* **Identifying Assets:** Discovering all associated domains, subdomains, and IP addresses provides a map of the target's online presence.
* **Uncovering Hidden Information:** Web reconnaissance aims to uncover directories, files, and technologies that are not readily apparent and could serve as entry points for an attacker.
* **Analyzing the Attack Surface:** By identifying open ports, running services, and software versions, you can assess the potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the target.
* **Gathering Intelligence:** Collecting information about employees, email addresses, and technologies used can aid in social engineering attacks or identifying specific vulnerabilities associated with certain software.

### Types of Reconnaissance

Web reconnaissance encompasses two fundamental methodologies: `active` and `passive` reconnaissance. Each approach offers distinct advantages and challenges, and understanding their differences is crucial for adequate information gathering.

#### Active Reconnaissance

In active reconnaissance, the attacker `directly interacts with the target system` to gather information. This interaction can take various forms:

| Technique                  | Description                                                                                   | Example                                                                                                                               | Tools                                                      | Risk of Detection                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Port Scanning**          | Identifying open ports and services running on the target.                                    | Using Nmap to scan a web server for open ports like 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).                                                        | Nmap, Masscan, Unicornscan                                 | High: Direct interaction with the target can trigger intrusion detection systems (IDS) and firewalls.              |
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | Probing the target for known vulnerabilities, such as outdated software or misconfigurations. | Running Nessus against a web application to check for SQL injection flaws or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.              | Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto                                     | High: Vulnerability scanners send exploit payloads that security solutions can detect.                             |
| **Network Mapping**        | Mapping the target's network topology, including connected devices and their relationships.   | Using traceroute to determine the path packets take to reach the target server, revealing potential network hops and infrastructure.  | Traceroute, Nmap                                           | Medium to High: Excessive or unusual network traffic can raise suspicion.                                          |
| **Banner Grabbing**        | Retrieving information from banners displayed by services running on the target.              | Connecting to a web server on port 80 and examining the HTTP banner to identify the web server software and version.                  | Netcat, curl                                               | Low: Banner grabbing typically involves minimal interaction but can still be logged.                               |
| **OS Fingerprinting**      | Identifying the operating system running on the target.                                       | Using Nmap's OS detection capabilities (`-O`) to determine if the target is running Windows, Linux, or another OS.                    | Nmap, Xprobe2                                              | Low: OS fingerprinting is usually passive, but some advanced techniques can be detected.                           |
| **Service Enumeration**    | Determining the specific versions of services running on open ports.                          | Using Nmap's service version detection (`-sV`) to determine if a web server is running Apache 2.4.50 or Nginx 1.18.0.                 | Nmap                                                       | Low: Similar to banner grabbing, service enumeration can be logged but is less likely to trigger alerts.           |
| **Web Spidering**          | Crawling the target website to identify web pages, directories, and files.                    | Running a web crawler like Burp Suite Spider or OWASP ZAP Spider to map out the structure of a website and discover hidden resources. | Burp Suite Spider, OWASP ZAP Spider, Scrapy (customisable) | Low to Medium: Can be detected if the crawler's behaviour is not carefully configured to mimic legitimate traffic. |

Active reconnaissance provides a direct and often more comprehensive view of the target's infrastructure and security posture. However, it also carries a higher risk of detection, as the interactions with the target can trigger alerts or raise suspicion.

#### Passive Reconnaissance

In contrast, passive reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target `without directly interacting` with it. This relies on analysing publicly available information and resources, such as:

| Technique                 | Description                                                                                                                     | Example                                                                                                                                           | Tools                                                                   | Risk of Detection                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Search Engine Queries** | Utilising search engines to uncover information about the target, including websites, social media profiles, and news articles. | Searching Google for "`[Target Name] employees`" to find employee information or social media profiles.                                           | Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, and specialised search engines (e.g., Shodan) | Very Low: Search engine queries are normal internet activity and unlikely to trigger alerts.           |
| **WHOIS Lookups**         | Querying WHOIS databases to retrieve domain registration details.                                                               | Performing a WHOIS lookup on a target domain to find the registrant's name, contact information, and name servers.                                | whois command-line tool, online WHOIS lookup services                   | Very Low: WHOIS queries are legitimate and do not raise suspicion.                                     |
| **DNS**                   | Analysing DNS records to identify subdomains, mail servers, and other infrastructure.                                           | Using `dig` to enumerate subdomains of a target domain.                                                                                           | dig, nslookup, host, dnsenum, fierce, dnsrecon                          | Very Low: DNS queries are essential for internet browsing and are not typically flagged as suspicious. |
| **Web Archive Analysis**  | Examining historical snapshots of the target's website to identify changes, vulnerabilities, or hidden information.             | Using the Wayback Machine to view past versions of a target website to see how it has changed over time.                                          | Wayback Machine                                                         | Very Low: Accessing archived versions of websites is a normal activity.                                |
| **Social Media Analysis** | Gathering information from social media platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook.                                          | Searching LinkedIn for employees of a target organisation to learn about their roles, responsibilities, and potential social engineering targets. | LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, specialised OSINT tools                    | Very Low: Accessing public social media profiles is not considered intrusive.                          |
| **Code Repositories**     | Analysing publicly accessible code repositories like GitHub for exposed credentials or vulnerabilities.                         | Searching GitHub for code snippets or repositories related to the target that might contain sensitive information or code vulnerabilities.        | GitHub, GitLab                                                          | Very Low: Code repositories are meant for public access, and searching them is not suspicious.         |

Passive reconnaissance is generally considered stealthier and less likely to trigger alarms than active reconnaissance. However, it may yield less comprehensive information, as it relies on what's already publicly accessible.
