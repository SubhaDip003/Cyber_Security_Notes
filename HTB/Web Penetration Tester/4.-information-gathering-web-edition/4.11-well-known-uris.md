# 4.11 Well-Known URIs

**Well-known URIs** are a standard way for websites to store important information in one predictable place.\
The `.well-known` directory is a special folder located at the root of a website, usually accessed as `/.well-known/`.

This folder contains **configuration and security-related files** that browsers, applications, and security tools know how to look for automatically. Because the location is fixed and standardized, tools don’t need to guess where this information is stored.

For example, if someone wants to find a website’s security contact or reporting policy, they can directly visit:\
`https://example.com/.well-known/security.txt`

The `Internet Assigned Numbers Authority` (`IANA`) maintains a [registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml) of `.well-known` URIs, each serving a specific purpose defined by various specifications and standards. Below is a table highlighting a few notable examples:

| URI Suffix                     | Description                                                                                           | Status      | Reference                                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `security.txt`                 | Contains contact information for security researchers to report vulnerabilities.                      | Permanent   | RFC 9116                                                                                |
| `/.well-known/change-password` | Provides a standard URL for directing users to a password change page.                                | Provisional | https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-change-password-url/#the-change-password-well-known-uri |
| `openid-configuration`         | Defines configuration details for OpenID Connect, an identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. | Permanent   | http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1\_0.html                              |
| `assetlinks.json`              | Used for verifying ownership of digital assets (e.g., apps) associated with a domain.                 | Permanent   | https://github.com/google/digitalassetlinks/blob/master/well-known/specification.md     |
| `mta-sts.txt`                  | Specifies the policy for SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) to enhance email security.      | Permanent   | RFC 8461                                                                                |

This is just a small sample of the many `.well-known` URIs registered with IANA. Each entry in the registry offers specific guidelines and requirements for implementation, ensuring a standardized approach to leveraging the `.well-known` mechanism for various applications.

### Web Recon and .well-known

In web recon, the `.well-known` URIs can be invaluable for discovering endpoints and configuration details that can be further tested during a penetration test.&#x20;

One important example is **`/.well-known/openid-configuration`**, which is used by websites that support **OpenID Connect** (a login system built on OAuth 2.0). When this endpoint is accessed, it returns a JSON file that describes how authentication works on that site. This endpoint returns a JSON document containing metadata about the provider's endpoints, supported authentication methods, token issuance, and more:

```json
{
  "issuer": "https://example.com",
  "authorization_endpoint": "https://example.com/oauth2/authorize",
  "token_endpoint": "https://example.com/oauth2/token",
  "userinfo_endpoint": "https://example.com/oauth2/userinfo",
  "jwks_uri": "https://example.com/oauth2/jwks",
  "response_types_supported": ["code", "token", "id_token"],
  "subject_types_supported": ["public"],
  "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": ["RS256"],
  "scopes_supported": ["openid", "profile", "email"]
}
```

From this single endpoint, you can easily discover:

* **Login and authorization URLs** (where users are redirected to log in)
* **Token endpoints** (where access tokens are issued)
* **User info endpoints** (where user profile data is fetched)
* **JWKS URI**, which shows the public keys used to sign tokens
* **Supported scopes, response types, and algorithms**, revealing what features and security methods are enabled

All of this information helps you understand how authentication is implemented and where to focus further testing. Exploring other `.well-known` endpoints listed by IANA can reveal even more useful metadata.
