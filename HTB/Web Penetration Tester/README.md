# 1. Web Requests

This note marks the beginning of our Web Penetration Testing learning path with the **Web Requests** module from Hack The Box. It lays the foundation for understanding how web applications communicate and how that communication can be analyzed from a security perspective.

In **HTTP Fundamentals**, we explore how the web works at its core—understanding HTTP and HTTPS, how requests are sent, how responses are received, and how headers control and describe that exchange. This knowledge helps us see what happens behind the browser and how data flows between a client and a server.

In **HTTP Methods**, we focus on how different actions are performed on the web. We learn how methods like GET and POST work, how APIs handle data, and how CRUD operations are implemented in real applications. This builds a clear understanding of how user actions translate into server-side behavior.

Together, this module gives us a strong base to read, analyze, and manipulate web requests—an essential skill for identifying and exploiting web vulnerabilities later in the learning path.
