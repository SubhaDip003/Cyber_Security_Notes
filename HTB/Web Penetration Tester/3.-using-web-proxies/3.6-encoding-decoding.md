# 3.6 Encoding/Decoding

To access the full encoder in Burp, we can go to the `Decoder` tab. In ZAP, we can use the `Encoder/Decoder/Hash` by clicking \[`CTRL+E`]. With these encoders, we can input any text and have it quickly encoded or decoded. For example, perhaps we came across the following cookie that is base64 encoded, and we need to decode it: `eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Imd1ZXN0IiwgImlzX2FkbWluIjpmYWxzZX0=`

We can input the above string in Burp Decoder and select `Decode as > Base64`, and we'll get the decoded value:

In recent versions of Burp, we can also use the `Burp Inspector` tool to perform encoding and decoding (among other things), which can be found in various places like `Burp Proxy` or `Burp Repeater`:

In ZAP, we can use the `Encoder/Decoder/Hash` tool, which will automatically decode strings using various decoders in the `Decode` tab:

> Tip: We can create customized tabs in ZAP's Encoder/Decoder/Hash with the "Add New Tab" button, and then we can add any type of encoder/decoder we want the text to be shown in. Try to create your own tab with a few encoders/decoders.

### Encoding

As we can see, the text holds the value `{"username":"guest", "is_admin":false}`. So, if we were performing a penetration test on a web application and find that the cookie holds this value, we may want to test modifying it to see whether it changes our user privileges. So, we can copy the above value, change `guest` to `admin` and `false` to `true`, and try to encode it again using its original encoding method (`base64`):

> Tip: Burp Decoder output can be directly encoded/decoded with a different encoder. Select the new encoder method in the output pane at the bottom, and it will be encoded/decoded again. In ZAP, we can copy the output text and paste it into the input field above.
