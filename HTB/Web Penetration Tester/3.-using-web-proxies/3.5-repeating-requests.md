# 3.5 Repeating Requests

### **Burp**

Once we locate the request we want to repeat, we can click \[`CTRL+R`] in Burp to send it to the `Repeater` tab, and then we can either navigate to the `Repeater` tab or click \[`CTRL+SHIFT+R`] to go to it directly. Once in `Repeater`, we can click on `Send` to send the request:

> We can also right-click on the request and select `Change Request Method` to change the HTTP method between POST/GET without having to rewrite the entire request.

***

### **ZAP**

In ZAP, once we locate our request, we can right-click on it and select `Open/Resend with Request Editor`, which would open the request editor window, and allow us to resend the request with the `Send` button to send our request:

We can also see the `Method` drop-down menu, allowing us to quickly switch the request method to any other HTTP method.

> Tip: By default, the Request Editor window in ZAP has the Request/Response in different tabs. You can click on the display buttons to change how they are organized. To match the above look choose the same display options shown in the screenshot.

We can achieve the same result within the pre-configured browser with `ZAP HUD`. We can locate the request in the bottom History pane, and once we click on it, the `Request Editor` window will show, allowing us to resend it. We can select `Replay in Console` to get the response in the same `HUD` window, or select `Replay in Browser` to see the response rendered in the browser:
