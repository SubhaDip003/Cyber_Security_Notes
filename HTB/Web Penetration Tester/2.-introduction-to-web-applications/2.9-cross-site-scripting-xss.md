# 2.9 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

`HTML Injection` vulnerabilities can often be utilized to also perform [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) attacks by injecting `JavaScript` code to be executed on the client-side. Once we can execute code on the victim's machine, we can potentially gain access to the victim's account or even their machine. `XSS` is very similar to `HTML Injection` in practice. However, `XSS` involves the injection of `JavaScript` code to perform more advanced attacks on the client-side, instead of merely injecting HTML code. There are three main types of `XSS`:

| Type            | Description                                                                                                                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Reflected XSS` | Occurs when user input is displayed on the page after processing (e.g., search result or error message).                                  |
| `Stored XSS`    | Occurs when user input is stored in the back end database and then displayed upon retrieval (e.g., posts or comments).                    |
| `DOM XSS`       | Occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is written to an `HTML` DOM object (e.g., vulnerable username or page title). |

In the example we saw for `HTML Injection`, there was no input sanitization whatsoever. Therefore, it may be possible for the same page to be vulnerable to `XSS` attacks. We can try to inject the following `DOM XSS` `JavaScript` code as a payload, which should show us the cookie value for the current user:

```js
#"><img src=/ onerror=alert(document.cookie)>
```

Once we input our payload and hit `ok`, we see that an alert window pops up with the cookie value in it:
