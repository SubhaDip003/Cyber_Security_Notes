# 2.6 JavaScript

[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) is one of the most used languages in the world. It is mostly used for web development and mobile development. `JavaScript` is usually used on the front end of an application to be executed within a browser. Still, there are implementations of back end JavaScript used to develop entire web applications, like [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/).

While `HTML` and `CSS` are mainly in charge of how a web page looks, `JavaScript` is usually used to control any functionality that the front end web page requires. Without `JavaScript`, a web page would be mostly static and would not have much functionality or interactive elements.

**Example**

Within the page source code, `JavaScript` code is loaded with the `<script>` tag, as follows:

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
..JavaScript code..
</script>
```

A web page can also load remote `JavaScript` code with `src` and the script's link, as follows:

```javascript
<script src="./script.js"></script>
```

### Frameworks

As web applications become more advanced, it may be inefficient to use pure `JavaScript` to develop an entire web application from scratch. This is why a host of `JavaScript` frameworks have been introduced to improve the experience of web application development.

These platforms introduce libraries that make it very simple to re-create advanced functionalities, like user login and user registration, and they introduce new technologies based on existing ones, like the use of dynamically changing `HTML` code, instead of using static `HTML` code.

These platforms either use `JavaScript` as their programming language or use an implementation of `JavaScript` that compiles its code into `JavaScript` code.

Some of the most common front end `JavaScript` frameworks are:

* [Angular](https://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_intro.asp)
* [React](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_intro.asp)
* [Vue](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_vue.asp)
* [jQuery](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/)
