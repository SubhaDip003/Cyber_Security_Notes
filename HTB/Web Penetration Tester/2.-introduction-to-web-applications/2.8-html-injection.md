# 2.8 HTML Injection

[HTML injection](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/11-Client-side_Testing/03-Testing_for_HTML_Injection) occurs when unfiltered user input is displayed on the page. This can either be through retrieving previously submitted code, like retrieving a user comment from the back end database, or by directly displaying unfiltered user input through `JavaScript` on the front end.

**Example**

The following example is a very basic web page with a single button "`Click to enter your name`." When we click on the button, it prompts us to input our name and then displays our name as "`Your name is ...`":

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (40).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If no input sanitization is in place, this is potentially an easy target for `HTML Injection` and `Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)` attacks. We take a look at the page source code and see no input sanitization in place whatsoever, as the page takes user input and directly displays it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<body>
    <button onclick="inputFunction()">Click to enter your name</button>
    <p id="output"></p>

    <script>
        function inputFunction() {
            var input = prompt("Please enter your name", "");

            if (input != null) {
                document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = "Your name is " + input;
            }
        }
    </script>
</body>

</html>
```

To test for `HTML Injection`, we can simply input a small snippet of `HTML` code as our name, and see if it is displayed as part of the page. We will test the following code, which changes the background image of the web page:

```html
<style> body { background-image: url('https://academy.hackthebox.com/images/logo.svg'); } </style>
```

Once we input it, we see that the web page's background image changes instantly:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (41).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
