# 2.3 Front End vs. Back End

### Front End

The front end of a web application contains the user's components directly through their web browser (client-side). These components make up the source code of the web page we view when visiting a web application and usually include `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, which is then interpreted in real-time by our browsers.

Aside from frontend code development, the following are some of the other tasks related to front end web application development:

* Visual Concept Web Design
* User Interface (UI) design
* User Experience (UX) design

### Back End

The back end of a web application drives all of the core web application functionalities, all of which is executed at the back end server, which processes everything required for the web application to run correctly. It is the part we may never see or directly interact with, but a website is just a collection of static web pages without a back end.

There are four main back end components for web applications:

| **Component**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Back end Servers       | The hardware and operating system that hosts all other components and are usually run on operating systems like `Linux`, `Windows`, or using `Containers`.                                                                   |
| Web Servers            | Web servers handle HTTP requests and connections. Some examples are `Apache`, `NGINX`, and `IIS`.                                                                                                                            |
| Databases              | Databases (`DBs`) store and retrieve the web application data. Some examples of relational databases are `MySQL`, `MSSQL`, `Oracle`, `PostgreSQL`, while examples of non-relational databases include `NoSQL` and `MongoDB`. |
| Development Frameworks | Development Frameworks are used to develop the core Web Application. Some well-known frameworks include `Laravel` (`PHP`), `ASP.NET` (`C#`), `Spring` (`Java`), `Django` (`Python`), and `Express` (`NodeJS JavaScript`).    |
