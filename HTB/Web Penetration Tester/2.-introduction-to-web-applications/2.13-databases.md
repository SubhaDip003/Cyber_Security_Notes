# 2.13 Databases

Web applications utilize back end [databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) to store various content and information related to the web application.

### Relational (SQL)

[Relational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) (SQL) databases store their data in tables, rows, and columns. Each table can have unique keys, which can link tables together and create relationships between tables.

> The relationship between tables within a database is called a Schema.

Some of the most common relational databases include:

| Type                                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL)                | The most commonly used database around the internet. It is an open-source database and can be used completely free of charge                                                                  |
| [MSSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server) | Microsoft's implementation of a relational database. Widely used with Windows Servers and IIS web servers                                                                                     |
| [Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database)     | A very reliable database for big businesses, and is frequently updated with innovative database solutions to make it faster and more reliable. It can be costly, even for big businesses      |
| [PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL)      | Another free and open-source relational database. It is designed to be easily extensible, enabling adding advanced new features without needing a major change to the initial database design |

Other common SQL databases include: `SQLite`, `MariaDB`, `Amazon Aurora`, and `Azure SQL`.

### Non-relational (NoSQL)

A [non-relational database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) does not use tables, rows, columns, primary keys, relationships, or schemas. Instead, a `NoSQL` database stores data using various storage models, depending on the type of data stored.

There are 4 common storage models for `NoSQL` databases:

* Key-Value
* Document-Based
* Wide-Column
* Graph

Each of the above models has a different way of storing data. For example, the `Key-Value` model usually stores data in `JSON` or `XML`, and has a key for each pair, storing all of its data as its value:

The above example can be represented using `JSON` as follows:

```json
{
  "100001": {
    "date": "01-01-2021",
    "content": "Welcome to this web application."
  },
  "100002": {
    "date": "02-01-2021",
    "content": "This is the first post on this web app."
  },
  "100003": {
    "date": "02-01-2021",
    "content": "Reminder: Tomorrow is the ..."
  }
}

```

Some of the most common `NoSQL` databases include:

| Type                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB)                   | The most common `NoSQL` database. It is free and open-source, uses the `Document-Based` model, and stores data in `JSON` objects                                                                 |
| [ElasticSearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch)       | Another free and open-source `NoSQL` database. It is optimized for storing and analyzing huge datasets. As its name suggests, searching for data within this database is very fast and efficient |
| [Apache Cassandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra) | Also free and open-source. It is very scalable and is optimized for gracefully handling faulty values                                                                                            |

Other common `NoSQL` databases include: `Redis`, `Neo4j`, `CouchDB`, and `Amazon DynamoDB`.
