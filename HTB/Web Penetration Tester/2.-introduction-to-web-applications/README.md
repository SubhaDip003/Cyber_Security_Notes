# 2. Introduction to Web Applications

This is our second module of our Web Penetration Testing learning path.\
The **Introduction to Web Applications** module from Hack The Box helps us understand what web applications actually are, how they are built, and where weaknesses can begin to appear.

We first look at how **front-end components** shape what users see and interact with, then explore common **front-end vulnerabilities** that can be introduced through insecure design or poor implementation. Next, we move to the **back-end components**, learning how servers, databases, and application logic work together behind the scenes, followed by **back-end vulnerabilities** that can lead to serious security risks if not handled properly.

Overall, this module builds a clear picture of how modern web applications function from both the user side and server side, preparing us to analyze them more deeply in future modules.
