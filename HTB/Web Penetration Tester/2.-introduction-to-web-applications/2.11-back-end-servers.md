# 2.11 Back End Servers

A back-end server is the hardware and operating system on the back end that hosts all of the applications necessary to run the web application. It is the real system running all of the processes and carrying out all of the tasks that make up the entire web application. The back end server would fit in the [Data access layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_layer).

### Software

The back end server contains the other 3 back end components:

* Web Server
* Database
* Development Framework

Other software components on the back end server may include [hypervisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor), containers, and WAFs.

There are many popular combinations of "stacks" for back-end servers, which contain a specific set of back end components. Some common examples include:

| Combinations                                                        | Components                                         |
